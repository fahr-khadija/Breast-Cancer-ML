# Project Objective 
Generate a good machine Learning model that can be used to classify patient with Breast Cancer from any input preprocessing data (DET) .

# Why we choose this topic:

Breast cancer, affecting 2.2 million individuals annually, is the most prevalent cancer worldwide. Early 
diagnosis significantly improves survival rates, and a key challenge lies in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. 
Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated the potential to dramatically enhance diagnostic accuracy, with research revealing a 97% success rate compared to 79% by experienced doctors.
Our upcoming project focuses on leveraging ML to classify breast tumors, aiming to increase 
diagnostic precision. By integrating advanced computational models, we seek to contribute to more 
effective interventions and align with the broader trend of incorporating technology to improve 
healthcare outcomes.

 ### General Description
Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin ====for more information you can visit this health links https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cance

# Interactive web page using Flask

 ## Project structure
 ### Data Model Implementation
     ## The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL 
        Generate function to cleaned Data , normalized, and standardized prior to modeling 
        Generate Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model  
     ### ![app.py]()    

  ### Data Model Optimization  
      Python script including the model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance

 ## Steps to build a simple web page using Flask:
   ###  1. Create mookup page:
         we use this mookup app to create our design of the web page  https://app.moqups.com/     
         https://app.moqups.com/5kKQrQQrlHi8gfX8tSXZGtFCNHLcjGMx/view/page/a3fbc0074

   ###  2. Create Project Structure:
        ◦ Create a new folder for the project.Project3
        ◦ Inside the project folder, create the following structure:
          /Project
              /static
                  /css
                     style.css
                  /js
                     app.js
                     function.js
                  /images
              /templates
                 index.html
              app.py

## Database
       ◦ CSV files are  from kaggl
         PANDAS to read the SQL file from the database
         SQLAlchemy to setup the database connection
         FLASK to host the data and the webpage
## App.py
